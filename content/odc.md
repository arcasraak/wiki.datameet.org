====== Open Data Camp ======
Open Data Camp is a one/two day unconference organized by Data{Meet} community. This will be a place for people who are working with data from many different sectors to come together and share their projects and ideas.

Data is not just for technologists and researchers – journalists, government workers, designers, and NGOs all use or want data in some way shape or form and in India the challenges around getting data and using it are unique and require a dedicated platform to work out solutions.

This includes looking at how to make data open so that it’s potential to create more accountability and transparency to improve policies and implementation of projects across industry, citizen sector organizations, and governance.

Data Camp will provide that platform for Indians to work out what are the problems around getting data and using it to further their projects and enhance the impact they want to make.
